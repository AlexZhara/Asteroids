# Asteroids
A basic Asteroids clone using the `pygame` library. Primarily based on a RealPython tutorial, with some changes added by me personally. No copy-pasted code.

## Objectives
My primary concern with this project was to demonstrate my grasp of OOP principles. A video game project seemed an appropriate medium for this.

Moreover, as a gamer, it was simply fun for me to learn how `pygame` works. I'll be sure to come back to this package in the future.

## Installation
1. Clone the project & setup a virtual environment
2. Install requirements from `requirements.txt` (or from the Pipfile, if using `pipenv`)
3. Launch through console: `python3 asteroids`
